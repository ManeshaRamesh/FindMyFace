# face-recognition-implementation-python
I used face_recognition.py to write a program that could search for a face in a folder of images. 

#### Requirements: 
  1. You must have Python 3.X
  2. You must install the face_recognition api
  
#### Installation:
For installation guidelines you can visit this [link](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
 
For windows users, the installation of the API is a bit tricky. I'll share what worked for me with you!
Install the following in order for this to work: 
  1. Visual Studio 2017/2015
  2. [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)
  3. dlib (pip install dlib==19.4)
  4. face_recognition API (pip install face_recognition)
 
You can also try the method suggested in this [link](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175).


#### Steps for use: 

  1. You can download this folder on your device. Then use your terminal or command Prompt to navigate to this directory.

  2. Add a clear image of your face to ./known

  3. Add all the other images to ./unkown

  4. Then run python find_my face.py. 

  Note: Make sure you read the README.txt files in all the folders!
