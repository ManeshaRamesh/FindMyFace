# face-recognition-implementation-python
I used face_recognition.py to write a program that could search for a face in a folder of images. 

you need to have Python 3.x installed on your device

You can download this folder on your device. Then use your terminal or command Prompt to navigate to this directory.

Add a clear image of your face to ./known

Add all the other images to ./unkown

Then run python find_my face.py. 

Note: Make sure you read the README.txt files in all the folders!
