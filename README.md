# face-recognition-implementation-python
I used face_recognition.py to write a program that could search for a face in a folder of images. 

Requirements: You need to have Python 3.x installed on your device

Steps: 

  1. You can download this folder on your device. Then use your terminal or command Prompt to navigate to this directory.

  2. Add a clear image of your face to ./known

  3. Add all the other images to ./unkown

  4. Then run python find_my face.py. 

  Note: Make sure you read the README.txt files in all the folders!
  
  HAve FUN!!
